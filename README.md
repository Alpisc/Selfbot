## Download this repo with `git clone https://github.com/Alpisc/Selfbot`

## Install requirements with `get-reqs.bat`
## If this is your first time using the bot, please consider running `setup.bat` to adjust the selfbot settings
## (If the Bot tells you that your config corrupted, worry not. This is likely because of a new update. Either re run `setup.bat` or add the config entry manually in `.content/config.json` (the `.content/template_config.json` always contains all needed fields))

all commands can be viewed with {prefix}cmds

## Please start the Bot from cmd instead of double clicking `Start.bat` (some commands behave weird if you don't)

have fun using it
