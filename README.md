# This bot is meant for pwz
## Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## If this is your first time using the bot, please consider using `setup_wizard.py` to adjust the selfbot settings
## (If the Bot tells you that your config corrupted, worry not. This is likely because of a new update. Either re run `setup_wizard.py` or add the config entry manually in `config.json` (the `template_config.json` always contains all needed fields)

all commands can be viewed with {prefix}cmds

## Please start the Bot from cmd instead of double clicking `windows_start.bat` (some commands behave weird if you don't)

have fun using it
